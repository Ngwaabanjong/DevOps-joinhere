# Jenkinsfile
- Save this content in a file named **Jenkinsfile** and include it in the root of your version-controlled project repository.
- Jenkins will automatically detect the Jenkinsfile and execute the defined pipeline stages. 
- Adjust the commands and stages based on your project's build and test requirements.

## Explanation:

- **pipeline:** Defines the beginning of a Jenkins Pipeline.
- **agent any:** Specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (Jenkins node).
- **stages:** Defines the different stages of the pipeline, such as Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy.
- Each **stage** contains a set of steps that define the tasks to be executed in that stage. 
- **post:** Defines post-build actions based on the outcome of the pipeline. In this example, we have defined actions for both success and failure scenarios.

## Code
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the source code from version control (e.g., Git)
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the Java project using Maven
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests using Maven
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // In a real-world scenario, you might deploy to a server or artifact repository
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        // Define post-build actions or notifications
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded! Sending notifications...'
            // You might send notifications here (e.g., email, Slack)
        }

        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed! Sending notifications...'
            // You might send notifications here (e.g., email, Slack)
        }
    }
}
```

## CODE SYNTAX FOR WORKER NODE:
```
pipeline {
    agent {
        // Specify the name of the worker node or a label
        node('your-worker-node') {
            // This block will run on the specified worker node
            // You can also use 'label' instead of 'node' if you're using a label
            // label 'your-label'
        }
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the source code from version control (e.g., Git)
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the project using your build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle)
                sh 'your-build-command'
            }
        }

        // Add more stages as needed (e.g., testing, deployment)
    }
}
```
