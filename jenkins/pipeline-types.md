# Type of pipelines
In Jenkins, there are two main approaches for defining pipelines: Declarative Pipeline and Scripted Pipeline. Both serve the purpose of defining continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows, but they differ in syntax, structure, and complexity.

### Declarative Pipeline:

1. **Declarative Syntax:**
   - Uses a more structured and simplified syntax that is designed to be easy to read and write.
   - Follows a predefined structure and set of directives.

2. **Human-Readable:**
   - Designed to be more human-readable and accessible to those who may not have extensive scripting experience.

3. **Limited Flexibility:**
   - Provides a limited set of predefined constructs and is generally less flexible than Scripted Pipeline.
   - Intended for straightforward, common CI/CD scenarios.

4. **Less Code:**
   - Typically requires less code to achieve common pipeline tasks.
  
5. **Automatic Stage Creation:**
   - Automatically generates some stages (like `Build` and `Test`) based on common pipeline structures.

Example of a Declarative Pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline succeeded! Sending notifications...'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed! Sending notifications...'
        }
    }
}
```

### Scripted Pipeline:

1. **Groovy Scripting:**
   - Relies on the full power of the Groovy programming language for pipeline scripting.
   - Allows for more complex logic and customizations.

2. **Greater Flexibility:**
   - Provides a high degree of flexibility and control over the pipeline flow.
   - Suitable for complex or unique CI/CD scenarios that may require custom scripting.

3. **Steep Learning Curve:**
   - May have a steeper learning curve for users who are not familiar with Groovy scripting.

4. **Explicit Stages:**
   - Requires explicit definition of stages, steps, and other pipeline elements.

Example of a Scripted Pipeline:

```groovy
node {
    stage('Build') {
        echo 'Building the application...'
        // Additional build steps using Groovy scripting
    }

    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Running tests...'
        // Additional test steps using Groovy scripting
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        echo 'Deploying the application...'
        // Additional deployment steps using Groovy scripting
    }

    // Post-build notifications
    catchError {
        echo 'Pipeline failed! Sending notifications...'
    }
    echo 'Pipeline succeeded! Sending notifications...'
}
```

### Choosing Between Declarative and Scripted Pipeline:

- **Use Declarative Pipeline When:**
  - You prefer a more structured and readable syntax.
  - Your CI/CD workflow aligns well with the predefined stages and constructs.
  - Your pipeline requirements are relatively simple and standard.

- **Use Scripted Pipeline When:**
  - You need more flexibility and control over the pipeline logic.
  - Your CI/CD workflow involves complex or custom scenarios.
  - You are comfortable with Groovy scripting and want to leverage its full capabilities.

In many cases, Declarative Pipeline is sufficient for standard CI/CD workflows, while Scripted Pipeline provides more flexibility for advanced use cases. Some organizations also use a combination of both, starting with Declarative and switching to Scripted when more customization is required.
