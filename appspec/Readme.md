AWS CodeDeploy uses a series of deployment stages to facilitate the process of deploying and updating applications on AWS infrastructure. These stages ensure that the deployment process is organized, manageable, and reliable. Here are the typical stages in an AWS CodeDeploy deployment:

1. **ApplicationStop**:
   - **Purpose**: This is the first stage of the deployment process. It is used to gracefully stop the current version of the application running on the deployment target.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can contain scripts or commands to perform any necessary tasks before stopping the application.

2. **DownloadBundle**:
   - **Purpose**: In this stage, the deployment package (typically a zip file) is downloaded from the specified source location. This package contains the new version of your application.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: This stage does not have any AppSpec file hooks by default. You typically don't need to perform custom actions at this stage.

3. **BeforeInstall**:
   - **Purpose**: This stage occurs before the new version of the application is installed. It is an opportunity to execute scripts or commands that prepare the system for the upcoming changes.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can include scripts or commands that are executed before the new version is installed. This stage is often used for tasks like creating directories, setting permissions, or preparing the environment.

4. **Install**:
   - **Purpose**: In this stage, the new version of the application is installed on the deployment target. This can include copying application files, libraries, and dependencies.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: This stage typically involves the installation of the new application version based on the instructions in the AppSpec file.

5. **AfterInstall**:
   - **Purpose**: After the new version is installed, this stage provides an opportunity to execute post-installation scripts or commands.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can include scripts or commands that are executed after the new version is installed. This stage is often used for tasks like database schema updates or cache warming.

6. **ApplicationStart**:
   - **Purpose**: This stage is used to start the newly installed version of the application.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can contain scripts or commands to start the application and any associated services.

7. **ValidateService** (optional):
   - **Purpose**: This optional stage is used to validate the health and readiness of the newly deployed application.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: This stage may not have specific hooks in the AppSpec file, as validation is typically implemented using health checks or other external tools.

8. **TrafficRouting**:
   - **Purpose**: This stage is critical in blue/green deployments. It involves routing traffic to the newly deployed version of the application, effectively switching from the old version to the new version.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can include scripts or commands that handle traffic routing, which may involve adjusting load balancer settings or DNS records.

9. **PostTraffic** (optional):
   - **Purpose**: This optional stage is used for additional tasks or validation after traffic routing is completed.
   - **AppSpec File Hooks**: Like the ValidateService stage, this stage may not have specific hooks in the AppSpec file. Additional validation or custom actions can be performed here.

10. **CleanUp**:
    - **Purpose**: In this final stage, any resources or files related to the old version of the application are cleaned up or removed from the deployment target.
    - **AppSpec File Hooks**: The AppSpec file can include scripts or commands to perform cleanup tasks, such as removing temporary files or old application versions.

Each of these stages plays a specific role in the deployment process, and the AppSpec file can contain hooks that allow you to customize the behavior at each stage according to your application's requirements. The specific stages and their order can vary depending on the deployment type (e.g., in-place, blue/green) and the requirements of your application.
