AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service provided by Amazon Web Services that automates the process of compiling source code, running tests, and packaging application artifacts. CodeBuild uses a series of build stages to manage the build process efficiently. Each stage represents a specific step in the build process, and you can configure these stages using an AWS BuildSpec file. Here are the typical stages in an AWS CodeBuild build:

1. **Source**:
   - **Purpose**: In this stage, the source code for your application is retrieved from a source code repository or a source location, such as AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, or Amazon S3. This is the initial step where the build process begins.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file can include instructions on how to fetch and prepare the source code for building.

2. **Environment**:
   - **Purpose**: The environment stage sets up the build environment, including the operating system, runtime, and environment variables needed for the build process.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: You can specify the runtime and environment variables in the BuildSpec file.

3. **Pre-Build**:
   - **Purpose**: This optional stage allows you to perform any pre-build actions or setup tasks, such as installing dependencies, setting up environment variables, or running scripts before the main build process.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file can include commands to be executed before the build process starts.

4. **Build**:
   - **Purpose**: This is the core stage where the actual build process occurs. It typically involves compiling source code, running tests, and generating build artifacts.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file specifies the build commands and actions to execute during this stage.

5. **Post-Build**:
   - **Purpose**: After the build stage, this optional stage allows you to perform post-build tasks, such as packaging artifacts, generating reports, or running additional tests.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file can include commands to be executed after the build process is complete.

6. **Artifacts**:
   - **Purpose**: In this stage, build artifacts, such as application binaries, libraries, or packages, are packaged and stored for later use or deployment.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file can define what artifacts to produce and where to store them.

7. **Cache**:
   - **Purpose**: The cache stage allows you to configure caching of dependencies and build artifacts. Caching can speed up the build process by reusing previously built components.
   - **BuildSpec File Configuration**: The BuildSpec file can specify what should be cached and where the cache should be stored.

These stages represent the default build stages in AWS CodeBuild. However, the actual number and nature of stages can vary based on your project's requirements and the content of your BuildSpec file. AWS CodeBuild is highly customizable, and you can add additional build phases or steps to accommodate your specific build and deployment needs.

In summary, AWS CodeBuild's build stages, configured using a BuildSpec file, allow you to automate and manage the entire build process for your applications, from source code retrieval to artifact generation. By customizing these stages, you can meet the specific requirements of your development and deployment workflows.
