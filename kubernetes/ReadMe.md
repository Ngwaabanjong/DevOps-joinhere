# What is Kubernetes?
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
- It allows you to easily manage and run containers (packaged applications with all their dependencies) in a distributed environment.

## Key components of Kubernetes include:

1. **Nodes:** Machines (physical or virtual) that run your applications. Nodes are grouped into a cluster.

2. **Master:** The central control unit that manages the cluster. It includes components like the API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd.

3. **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers. Containers within a pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost.

4. **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of replicas (copies) of a pod are running at all times.

5. **Service:** A stable endpoint that exposes a set of pods, allowing them to communicate with each other or external services.

6. **Deployment:** A higher-level abstraction that allows you to declaratively manage pod replicas and update configurations.

Kubernetes simplifies the process of deploying and managing containerized applications, providing tools to handle scaling, load balancing, and rolling updates with ease. It abstracts away many complexities associated with distributed systems, making it easier to develop and operate applications in a containerized environment.
